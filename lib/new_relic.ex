  Set the name of the current transaction.

  The first segment will be treated as the Transaction namespace,
  and commonly contains the name of the framework.

  **Notes:**
  * At least 2 segments are required to light up the Transactions UI in APM

  In the following example, you will see `/custom/transaction/name`
  in the Transaction list.

  Report custom attributes on the current Transaction

  Reporting nested data structures is supported by auto-flattening them
  into a list of key-value pairs.

  ```elixir
  NewRelic.add_attributes(foo: "bar")

  NewRelic.add_attributes(map: %{foo: "bar", baz: "qux"})
    # "map.foo" => "bar"

    # "list.0" => "a"
    # "list.1" => "b"
    # "list.2" => "c"
    # "list.length" => 3
  ```

  * Nested Lists and Maps are truncated at 10 items since there are a limited number
  of attributes that can be reported on Transaction events

  Start an "Other" Transaction.

  This will begin monitoring the current process as an "Other" Transaction

  * Don't use this to track Web Transactions - Plug based HTTP servers
  are auto-instrumented based on `telemetry` events.
  * Do _not_ use this for processes that live a very long time, doing so
  will risk a memory leak tracking attributes in the transaction!
  * You can't start a new transaction within an existing one. Any process
  spawned inside a transaction belongs to that transaction.
  * If multiple transactions are started in the same Process, you must
  call `NewRelic.stop_transaction()` to mark the end of the transaction.

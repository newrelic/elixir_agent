The experimental open-source Elixir agent allows you to monitor your `Elixir` applications with New Relic. It helps you track transactions, distributed traces, other parts of your application's behavior, and provides an overview of underlying [BEAM activity](https://github.com/newrelic/elixir_agent/wiki/BEAM-stats-page).

### License
The open-source Elixir agent is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Installation

Install the [Hex package](https://hex.pm/packages/new_relic_agent)

Requirements:
* Erlang/OTP 24
* Elixir 1.11

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:new_relic_agent, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

If using an Elixir version before 1.18.x, please also add `:jason` to your dependency list.

```elixir
{:jason, "~> 1.0"}
```

## Configuration

You need to set a few required configuration keys so we can authenticate properly.

#### Via Application config

```elixir
config :new_relic_agent,
  app_name: "My App",
  license_key: "license_key"
```

#### Via Environment variables

You can also configure these attributes via `ENV` vars, which helps keep secrets out of source code.

* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`
* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`

#### HTTP Client Settings

`:httpc` client settings can be overridden if needed. For example, the HTTP connect timeout can be increased which can help alleviate errors related to timeouts connecting to New Relic:

```elixir
config :new_relic_agent,
  app_name: "My App",
  license_key: "license_key",
  httpc_request_options: [connect_timeout: 5000]
```

* [`Oban`](https://github.com/oban-bg/oban): See [NewRelic.Telemetry.Oban](https://hexdocs.pm/new_relic_agent/NewRelic.Telemetry.Oban.html) for details.
* [`Absinthe`](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe): See [NewRelic.Telemetry.Absinthe](https://hexdocs.pm/new_relic_agent/NewRelic.Telemetry.Absinthe.html) for details.

## Agent features

There are a few agent features that can be enabled via configuration. Please see the documentation for more information.

* [Logs In Context](https://hexdocs.pm/new_relic_agent/NewRelic.Config.html#feature/1-logs-in-context)
* [Infinite Tracing](https://hexdocs.pm/new_relic_agent/NewRelic.Config.html#feature/1-infinite-tracing)
* [Security Controls](https://hexdocs.pm/new_relic_agent/NewRelic.Config.html#feature?/1-security)

## Manual Instrumentation

#### Transactions

Transactions are the main unit of work reported to New Relic. `Plug` and `Phoenix` instrumentation automatically report a Web Transaction for each request. `Oban` instrumentation reports an "Other" Transaction for each job. You can also report custom transactions for work done in your app.

These Transactions will propagate to any process spawned and linked (ex: `Task.async`), but will _not_ follow a process that isn't linked (ex: `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink`).

---

To manually connect a Transaction to an unlinked process, you can use `NewRelic.get_transaction` and `NewRelic.connect_to_transaction`. See the docs for those functions for further details.

```elixir
tx = NewRelic.get_transaction()

spawn(fn ->
  NewRelic.connect_to_transaction(tx)
  # ...
end)
```

---

To exclude a process from the Transaction:

```elixir
Task.async(fn ->
  NewRelic.exclude_from_transaction()
  Work.wont_be_tracked()
end)
```

---

To prevent reporting an individual transaction:

```elixir
NewRelic.ignore_transaction()
```

You can configure some paths to be automatically ignored:

```elixir
config :new_relic_agent,
  ignore_paths: [
    "/health",
    ~r/longpoll/
  ]
```

---

If you are using a `Task` to spawn work, you can use the pre-instrumented `NewRelic.Instrumented.Task` convenience module to make this easier. Just `alias` it in your module and all your Tasks will be instrumented. You may also use the functions directly.

```elixir
alias NewRelic.Instrumented.Task

Task.Supervisor.async_nolink(MyTaskSupervisor, fn ->
  # This process will be automatically connected to the current Transaction...
end)
```

---

You may start an "Other" Transaction for non-HTTP related work. This could used be while consuming from a message queue, for example.

```elixir
defmodule Worker do
  use NewRelic.Tracer

  def process_messages do
    NewRelic.other_transaction("Worker", "ProcessMessages") do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

#### Function Tracing

`NewRelic.Tracer` enables detailed Function tracing. Annotate a function and it'll show up as a span in Transaction Traces / Distributed Traces, and we'll collect aggregate stats about it. Install it by adding `use NewRelic.Tracer` to any module, and annotating any function with an `@trace` module attribute

```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  use NewRelic.Tracer

  @trace :work
  def work do
    # Will report as `MyModule.work/0`

    NewRelic.add_span_attributes(some: "attribute")
  end
end
```

If you want to trace a sub-set of a function, you can use the `NewRelic.span` macro.

```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  use NewRelic.Tracer

  def work do
    # Do some stuff..

    NewRelic.span "do.some_work", user_id: "abc123" do
      # Span will report as `do.some_work` and have a `user_id` attribute
      # Will return the result of the block
    end
  end
end
```

#### Distributed Tracing

Requests to other services can be connected with an additional outgoing header.

```elixir
defmodule MyExternalService do
  def request(method, url, headers) do
    headers = headers ++ NewRelic.distributed_trace_headers(:http)
    HttpClient.request(method, url, headers)
  end
end
```

#### Mix Tasks

`NewRelic.Instrumented.Mix.Task` To enable the agent and record an Other Transaction during a `Mix.Task`, simply `use NewRelic.Instrumented.Mix.Task`. This will ensure the agent is properly started, records a Transaction, and is shut down.

```elixir
defmodule Mix.Tasks.Example do
  use Mix.Task
  use NewRelic.Instrumented.Mix.Task

  def run(args) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

#### Disabling

If you want to disable the agent, you can do it in two different ways:

* Application config: `config :new_relic_agent, license_key: nil`
* Environment variables: `NEW_RELIC_HARVEST_ENABLED=false`
